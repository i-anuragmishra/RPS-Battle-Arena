- **Real-time Transformations**: Watch objects transform upon collision based on Rock Paper Scissors rules
- **Visual Counters**: Track the count of each object type in real-time
- **Triangle Formation Start**: Objects begin in a strategic triangle formation
- **Countdown Timer**: Starts with a countdown sequence for dramatic effect
- **Victory Detection**: Automatically detects when one type dominates the arena
- **Replay Function**: Easily restart the simulation with a click

## Game Rules 📋

The traditional Rock Paper Scissors rules apply:
